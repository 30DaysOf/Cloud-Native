## How do I ask questions?

We want you to attend and engage with the experts **LIVE** - and ask questions on the chat there.

However, we **encourage you to submit your questions ahead of time** where possible, so we can the experts get through as many questions as possible during the segment. This also allows others to _upvote_ posted questions (to indicate priority) and gives us a chance to post responses to questions that did not make the live broadcast due to time constraints.

:::info TO SUBMIT YOUR QUESTION EARLY:

 * Open a [New Issue](https://github.com/Azure/Cloud-Native/issues/new/choose) on the repo.
 * Select [Get Started](https://github.com/Azure/Cloud-Native/issues/new?assignees=&labels=ask+the+expert&template=---ask-the-expert-.md&title=%5BAsk+The+Expert%5D++) - uses the **üé§ Ask the Expert!** template.
 * Fill in the template details, and submit!

:::

You can also look at [already posted questions](https://github.com/Azure/Cloud-Native/issues?q=+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22ask+the+expert%22+) and üëçüèΩ the question - or add a reply with more context or comments - to indicate your interest.
