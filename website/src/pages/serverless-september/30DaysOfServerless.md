# 30 Days Of Serverless: Roadmap

Welcome to **#30DaysOfServerless** - a month-long beginner-friendly journey into building serverless solutions on Azure! Over the next 4 weeks we'll share daily blog posts, authored by serverless experts and practitioners from diverse teams, to guide you on a journey across the Serverless landscape on Azure. We've organized the journey into 4 stages:

 * **Go Serverless** with Azure Functions
 * **Deploy Microservices** with Azure Container Apps
 * **Simplify Integrations** with Azure Event Grid & Logic Apps
 * **Build End-to-End Solutions** using familiar Dev Tools & Languages


:::danger TENTATIVE ROADMAP
This page shows our planned roadmap for the month (Sep 1-30, 2022). However, we may modify the content or sequence of posts as we go, in response to _your_ requests and feedback.

## Azure Container Apps

_Welcome to Week 2. You've learnt how to build event-driven serverless backends using Azure Functions. But how can you orchestrate and scale more complex solutions? The answer lies in microservice architectures and containerized apps. This week we explore Azure Container Apps (ACA) - and learn how the Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr) technology can work alongside ACA to unlock richer capabilities and simplify developer experience.
