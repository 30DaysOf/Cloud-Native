## ‚ú® Serverless September For Students

My love for the tech industry grows as it evolves. Not just for the new technologies to play with, but seeing how paths into a tech career continue to expand. Allowing so many new voices, ideas and perspectives to our industry. With [serverless computing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-serverless-computing/?WT.mc_id=academic-75239-sagibbon) removing barriers of entry for so many.

It's a reason I enjoy working with universities and students. I get to hear the excitement of learning, fresh ideas and perspectives from our student community. All you students are incredible! How you view serverless, and what it can do, so cool!  

This year for Serverless September we want to hear all the amazing ways our student community is learning and working with Azure Serverless, and have all new ways for you to participate.
