## üçÇ September is Coming!!

And we all know what that means! It's almost time for **#Serverless September**  - described as:
> "a month of content-driven learning where experts and practitioners share their insights and tutorials on how to use serverless technologies effectively in today's ecosystems"

Why does that sound familiar? 

Because I wrote those words [2 years ago](https://dev.to/azure/serverlessseptember-just-5-things-you-need-to-know-3p9e) when we were just kickstarting the 2020 edition of the series. You might even recall _this_ visual from that series.

You can still browse the [2020 Content Collection](https://dev.to/azure/serverlessseptember-2020-content-collection-443k) to find great talks, articles and code samples to get started using Serverless on Azure.


## üßê So - What's New In 2022?

Quite a few things actually! 

> Hosted Content Website 

We created this awesome website as a _permanent (canonical) home_ for the content in 2022 and beyond. Content will still be syndicated to dev.to, but this gives us the ability to also share _other_ resources to help you continue your learning journey beyond September.

> Beyond Content Collections

In previous years, we curated and shared content collections that focused on serverless usage. This year, we wanted to do a little bit more to provide a _structured_ learning experience that would be beginner-friendly, but with signature activities to _skill up_ for experienced developers. 

In fact, here's a sneak peek at #ServerlessSeptember this year - you'll go from Code to Containers to Cloud!

This has been a labor of love from multiple teams at Microsoft! We can't wait to share all the resources that we hope will help _you_ skill up on all things Serverless this September!
